## Introduction

> Intelligence is the potential for acquiring knowledge.  
> **Ruchira Bomiriya**

You need intelligence to be able to acquire knowledge — to learn.  If you can’t acquire knowledge, you simply can’t learn.  Understanding the learning process makes us more conscious, reflective and intentional in our future actions.  It also helps us create intelligent systems — mechanisms and tools — that aid us to live better.

I was a computer engineering student when I first encountered the application of pattern recognition in a real life commercial application.  I have been intrigued by the subject of learning ever since.  In the last three decades, I have studied and experimented with  how learning actually works.  I found out that different people learn differently and that there is a significant genetic component to how an individual learns.

I intend to document my findings in an easily digestible way.  It is useful to have a metaphor or an analogy that the reader or the listener is already familiar with to explain a new or related idea.  With apologies to those who are not too familiar with computers, I will use the metaphor of a computer at a conceptual level to explain the role of the central consciousness (the observer) in orchestrating intelligence.
